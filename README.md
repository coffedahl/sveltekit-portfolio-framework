# Sveltekit Portfolio Framework
This project was an attempt to create a sveltekit portfolio framework with an login to easily create new `portfolio` projects and publish them on the website.

`This project is dead/frozen`

I do not develop on this project anymore because the scope of the project became to large for the problem it was trying to solve. I also changed the way i wanted to publish my personal website and therefore do not develop any more on this project.
I might revisit the project if i ever have the time and energy but consider it `dead` ☠️

- Nodejs

```bash
